# Fracture energy
Data collection including published research data on the topic of fracture energy. In Cocco et al., in prep, we tried to include the broadest number of fracture energy estimates as possible, from many communities, ranging from laboratory, field geology, modelling and seismology.  

Contributors of this work are (in alphabetical order):
- Aretusini, S.

We hosted our data collection here in Github to benefit from the collaborative nature of this community.

The first release of this repository will be published directly to Zotero.

Further releases will be improved also according to the feedback from the community via the Issues to this repository. 
All contributors acknowledge that at its current state this data collection is not complete and hope to complete it further thanks to the scientific community.

We acknowledge for providing their data:
