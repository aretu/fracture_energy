# Fracture energy
Data collection including published research data on the topic of fracture energy. In Cocco et al., in prep, we tried to include the broadest number of fracture energy estimates as possible, from many communities, ranging from laboratory, field geology, modelling and seismology.  

We hosted our data collection here in Github to benefit from the collaborative nature of this community.

This data is discussed in a review paper (link).

## Laboratory
Estimates of fracture energy with rock deformation laboratory experiments.

## Geology
Estimates of fracture energy with rock deformation laboratory experiments.

## Models
Estimates of fracture energy with numerical models.

## Seismology
Estimates of fracture energy with from seismologic data (natural, induced, and laboratory seismic events).
