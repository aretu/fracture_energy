# Fracture energy
Data collection including published research data on the topic of fracture energy. I tried to include the broadest number of fracture energy estimates that I could possibly do, from many communities, ranging from laboratory, field geology, modelling and seismology.  

It is hosted here because I thought this data collection could benefit from the collaborative nature of Github.

This data is discussed in a review paper (link).

## Laboratory
Estimates of fracture energy with rock deformation laboratory experiments.

## Geology
Estimates of fracture energy with rock deformation laboratory experiments.

## Models
Estimates of fracture energy with numerical models.

## Seismology
Estimates of fracture energy with from seismologic data (natural, induced, and laboratory seismic events).
